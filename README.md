# Unsupervised_Learning_Clustering

Unsupervised Machine Learning is used when Data is not labeled that means data points have unknown outcome. Two types of unsupervised machine learning are available - Clustering and Dimensionality Reduction. In case of clustering, KMeans, Hierarchical Agglomerative clustering, DBSCAN, Mean Shift are common algorithms and in case of dimensionality reduction, PCA, Non-negative Matrix Factorization are very common algorithms.
The main objective of the analysis is to predict the customer channel whether they are from hotel/restaurant/caf√© or from retail business depending on their purchase history of different items. Here we focused on the clustering algorithm to build the model. The benefits of this analysis are to provide a better idea about the customers to enhance the facilities to the wholesale distributors. We chose three different clustering models such as KMeans, Agglomerative and Mean Shift and chose the right model from comparing their ROC_AUC scores.
