# Unsupervised_Learning_Clustering

Unsupervised Machine Learning is used when Data is not labeled that means data points have unknown outcome. Two types of unsupervised machine learning is available - Clustering and Dimensionality Reduction. In case of clustering, KMeans, Hierarchical Agglomerative clustering, DBSCAN, Mean Shift are common algorithms and in case of dimensionality reduction, PCA, Non-negative Matrix Factorization is very common algorithms.

Thanks to Coursera and IBM for arranging this project to strengthen our knowledge. 
## Installation
This project needs Anaconda package(Anaconda3), Jupyter Notebook (6.1.4).

## File Description
The source codes are as follows:
- Classification_Final_Project.ipynb
- Classification_Final_Project.html
- churndata_processed.csv
- Report_Classification.pdf

## Discussion
After completing this project, I understand how we can build the classification algorithm based model such as Logistic regression, KNN, Random Forest.
